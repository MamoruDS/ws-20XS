# Raycast Scripts

## Configuration

Add config storage location as environment variable `RAYCAST_CONFIG`

```shell
# your .zshrc
export RAYCAST_CONFIG=$HOME/.config/raycast
```

_PS_. Since i haven't finger out how Raycast working with `ENV`, configuration may not working at all, try to change default of configable variables in script manually
